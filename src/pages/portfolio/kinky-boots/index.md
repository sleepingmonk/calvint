**Credit:** Lighting Operator / Trainer

This was an over the top, sell-out musical production put on by the ECHO Players and directed by Gary Brown. The cast and crew were all amazing.

I was a lighting operator for this show, and also had the task of training and coordinating a few new lighting operators. I love to see new volunteers get involved in theatre tech, and this group did a fantastic job.
