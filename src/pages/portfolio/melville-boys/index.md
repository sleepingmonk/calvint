## A Touching Comedy by Norm Foster

Two brothers, two sisters, life and legacy. That's a lot to pack into one weekend at the lake.

I've been cast as Lee, the older brother, grappling with reality while his younger brother (Owen) tries to do anything but. I look forward to finding the balance between situational comedy and deep emotion in this role.

I'm excited to work with this amazing team. Come see the show in October!
