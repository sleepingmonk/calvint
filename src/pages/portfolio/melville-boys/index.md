## A Touching Comedy by Norm Foster

Two brothers, two sisters, death and living the life we have. That's a lot to pack into one weekend at the lake.

I've been cast as Lee, the older brother, grappling with reality while his younger brother (Owen) tries to do anything but. I look forward to finding the balance between situational comedy and deep emotion in this role.

I'm excited to work with the rest of the team, rehearsals start soon. Come see the show in October!

Tickets on sale in August, set a reminder!
