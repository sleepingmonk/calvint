## A Touching Comedy by Norm Foster

Two brothers, two sisters, life and legacy. That's a lot to pack into one weekend at the lake.

I've been cast as Lee, the older brother, grappling with reality while his younger brother (Owen) tries to do anything but. I look forward to finding the balance between situational comedy and deep emotion in this role.

### Update

I can't believe it's over. We had an amazing run with sold-out shows and standing ovations. The cast and crew were fantastic, and I am so grateful to have been part of this production. I can't wait for the next one!

Speaking of the next one, watch for The Dating Game in February 2026!
