**Credit:** Technical Director

In May 2025, I had the privilege of serving as the Technical Director for the North Island Zone Festival, hosted by ECHO Players at the Village Theatre in Qualicum, BC. This annual festival showcases a variety of theatrical productions from the North Island Zone of Vancouver Island.

As Technical Director, I was responsible for overseeing all technical aspects of the festival, including lighting, sound, etc. I made sure everyone had the information and resources they needed for a successful show. The festival featured a diverse lineup of plays, each with its own unique technical requirements.
