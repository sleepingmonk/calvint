**Credit:** Andrew / The Handsome Drunk

Director Michael King was nice enough to cast me in another fun production. This time in a bit of a bigger role, as Andrew, willing to do what it takes to join his new girlfriend on an all girls trip to London.

I also had the pleasure of playing The Handsome Drunk, a fun character who gets to serenade a couple of ladies from the group as they make their way through London on a walk to raise money for charity. It was a little daunting to sing acapella in front of a live audience, but hey, he was drunk and handsome, so I hope also charming enough to pull it off. ;)
