This was a fascinating play by Lauren Gunderson, put on by ECHO Players. It's a fictionalized account of four female figures from the French Revolution: Olympe de Gouges, Marie Antoinette, Charlotte Corday, and Marianne Angelle. The play is a mix of comedy and drama, and it explores themes of power, revolution, and the role of women in history.

I was assitant sound designer with Jennifer Kelly, for which we won Best Sound at the North Island Zone Festival. As sound operator for this production, I enjoyed seeing this every night for the 3 week run, and at festival. It's a challenging play for actors and they all did brilliantly.
