**Credit:** Audio: Front of House Engineer

This is a new play by Canadian playwright Michael Armstrong. I had the distinct pleasure of being the audio engineer for Beth DeVolder, a wonderful musician and composer, who provided live music for the show.

The play was directed by the plawright himself, and featured a cast of talented actors. Michael's vision for this play brought a unique and engaging experience to the audience. The fascinating life story of his mother played out before us like a dream, flowing form one scene to the next with music and sound weaving it all together.

It was a unique and rewarding experience to help bring this play to the North Island Zone Festival this year. I hope to work with everyone again in the future!
