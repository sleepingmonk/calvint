This was my first business. A partnership with a fellow performer. We provided our own entertainment services and the services of a small group of variety artists. It paid the bills and was a great learning experience.

## Highlights

Prior to this I was a street performer and worked in a magic shop, where I had the opportunity to hone my craft and sharpen my skills all day, demoing (selling) product to customers and teaching magic.

A partner and I had been developing an escape act we wanted to play at festivals and anywhere with a good busking scene. The first stop was our home town of Calgary Alberta, Canada for Canada Day celebrations and the Stampede, which brought people from all over the world to the streets of downtown Calgary.

It was a good summer but the touring plans fell through and I found myself needing to do something else. I started getting noticed in bars and night clubs and was invited to work in various places. Then teamed up with some new magic friends to become the preeminent supplier of variety entertainment in the city.
