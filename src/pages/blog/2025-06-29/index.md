Just a quick update to let you know that I've been cast in **The Melville Boys**. See the post in the portfolio section for more details.

[The Melville Boys](/portfolio/melville-boys)

This will be a new challenge for me as an actor. Its a big role, and while its a comedy, it has a lot of depth and emotion. So far I've had the chance to play smaller parts, or "coarse" parts in farces and pantos. I'm really looking forward to digging into this and seeing what I can bring to the character of Lee.
