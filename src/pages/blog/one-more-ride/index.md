Leather and gasoline\
asphalt and dreams\
The winding road, the long way home\
No straight lines from A to B\
We only have a few short months\
before we lose the roads\
So I gear up and I take\
one more ride before the cold

One more ride before the cold\
is all that's on my mind\
The cooling breeze upon my face\
the landscape in my eyes\
I twist the throttle to unlock\
the last piece of my soul\
The wheels spin, my face, a grin\
One more ride before the cold

In this life travelling\
many ways down many paths\
I’ve done my best to leave a mark\
to create some things that last\
They say the final walk is one\
we all must walk alone\
If that’s the case I’ll take my bike\
One more ride before the cold
